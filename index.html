						<h1>Ki Cooley-Winters</h1>
						<h3>Math & CS undergrad at Columbia with a passion for all things AI</h3>
						<p>I aspire to leverage the power of math and science to break past human cognitive limitations and make the world a better place.

						What inspires me is progress--whether it be as big as landing on the moon or as small as a faster version of Chrome. I'm a strong believer in the inseparability of technological innovation and moral and social progress. As Steven Pinker asserts, technology not only makes use better off individually; it also makes us more open, empathetic, and altruistic.

						I believe the best way to make progress is by applying the empirical, rigorous tools of math and science. Cognitive psychology shows us that human reasoning fails in many systematic and predictable ways when dealing with complex and ambiguously defined problems. Unfortunately, the most pressing problems are usually the kind where we are most error-prone: climate change, public health, or even vehicle traffic.

						I strive to use research from psychology as well as statistics to try to improve reasoning on an individual level. However, these kinds of insights can also contribute to the development of AI to solve problems previously beyond us. My dream is to find a significant way to contribute as this field evolves.

						I’m also fascinated by learning how to bring people together to solve these problems. The world is rarely changed by one person, so I’m very invested in learning how to inspire and lead others to build amazing things together.

						My interests lie primarily in computer science and AI but extend to every field with something to say about reasoning or progress--statistics, philosophy, economics, psychology, physics, and math. I have a particular love for the beauty of mathematical abstraction found in all of these fields.

						When not thinking about these ideas, I love reading about and exploring my favorite place on earth, New York City. You can usually find me out at Broadway musicals, jazz clubs, museums, or watching stand up comedy.</p>
